# This is readme file

## Swift Basic
> PS: when learning Swift, we can write code in **Playground**, it's something like the jupyter notebook for Python.
1. var for variable and let for contant, you can only assign value to constant once
2. you can explicitly set type fo var or constant, like `var my_value: Double = 4`
3. swift doesn't implicity convert variable type, you must explicity convert a variable to another type if you want, like `widthLabel=label+String(width)`
4. more convinient way to include variables in a string: `"I have \(sum) apples"`
