# Connections Basic
1. There 3 kindes of collections in swift:
- Array: ordered
- Set: Unordered
- Dict: Unordered, Key-Value
> all 3 kinds of collections are type-sensitive, all items in the connection must have the same type.

2. mutability
- if you use `var` to create an `array`,`set` or `dict`, you can both change its item and point it to another collect.
- if you use `let` to create a collect, you can change its value, but you cannot point it to another collect.

# Arrays
1. Arrays store value in ordered list, arrays can have the same value appears multiple times.
